# My Browser Extension Cleanup Report

## Introduction
So, I got this task to figure out how to spot and get rid of any shady browser extensions, and I thought it’d be a good chance to clean up my Chrome a bit. This report is all about what I did and what I learned along the way.

## Objectives
- Learn how to find and remove dodgy browser extensions.
- Write down everything I found and did.

## Methodology
1. I started by opening the extensions page in Chrome—super easy to find under the settings.
2. I went through every single extension I had installed, taking my time to check them out.
3. For each one, I looked at the permissions it needed and read the reviews to see if anything seemed off.
4. I noticed one extension, “AdBoost,” that I didn’t remember adding—it had weird permissions and no good reviews.
5. I decided to remove “AdBoost” since it felt suspicious.
6. After that, I restarted Chrome to see if it made a difference.
7. I did some quick research online and found out malicious extensions can steal data or spam you with ads.
8. Finally, I wrote this report to keep track of my steps.

## Results
- I found and deleted that “AdBoost” extension—it was definitely sketchy.
- After removing it, my browser feels a bit snappier, though it’s hard to tell for sure.
- I’m way more aware now of how extensions can be risky if you’re not careful.

## Discussion
Going through this made me realize I should check my extensions more often. “AdBoost” probably came with some free software I downloaded ages ago. I’ll definitely be pickier about where I get extensions from now on and maybe check reviews more closely.

## Conclusion
This task really helped me get a handle on keeping my browser secure. It wasn’t too hard, and I’m glad I caught that one bad extension.

## Recommendations
- I should probably check my extensions every month or so.
- Stick to downloading from the Chrome Web Store to avoid trouble.
- Maybe keep an eye on performance after removing stuff like this.
