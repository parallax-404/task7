# My Browser Extension Security Task

## Overview
I took on this task to clean up my browser extensions and learn more about keeping things secure. I used Chrome and followed the guide they gave us to get it done.

## Files
- `Task_Report.md`: My report on how I tackled the task and what I found.
- `screenshot.png`: A spot for my screenshot—I'll add one showing before and after I removed the extension.
- `README.md`: This file, where I’m explaining what I did.

## Setup Instructions
1. Just open Chrome and go to the extensions page.
2. Follow the steps I wrote in my report to check and remove anything suspicious.
3. No fancy tools needed—just the browser itself!

## Usage
- Check out `Task_Report.md` to see how I did everything step by step.
- I’ll add `screenshot.png` with a before-and-after of the extensions page—stay tuned!
- Use this repo to submit the task.

## Notes
- I found and got rid of “AdBoost,” which looked shady to me.
- Did this all with Chrome’s built-in features—no paid stuff.
- Don’t forget to snap that screenshot and add it before submitting!
